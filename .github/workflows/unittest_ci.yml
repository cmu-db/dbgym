    # We could choose to set up dependencies manually in the GHA runner instead of installing them during the GHA.
    #
    # However, I think it's better to do them in the GHA itself so that we're testing our dependency installation step
    # in addition to our actual code. It also removes the need to manually reinstall dependencies on the GHA runners
    # every time we add a new dependency.
    #
    # Note that the GHA runners are stateful. Dependencies installed from previous runs will still be on the runner.
    # This means this step will usually be pretty fast as most dependencies will already be cached. However, it also
    # means that past runs might interfere with the current run, so you sometimes may need to restart the GHA runners.
