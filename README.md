## Concepts to Include
I'm not writing the README now because the overall structure depends on what needs to be included, which I don't know yet.
However, it's still useful to note down what needs to be included as it comes up so I don't need to go and remember.
Here is the list:
- The `dbgym_workspace/` directory and its structure
- What `open_and_save()` as well as the distinction between configs, dependencies, and results
