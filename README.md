*An end-to-end research vehicle for self-driving databases.*

## Quickstart

These steps were tested on a fresh repository clone, Ubuntu 22.04.

```
# Setup dependencies.
# You may want to create a Python 3.10 virtual environment (e.g. with conda) before doing this.
./dependency/install_dependencies.sh

# Compile a custom fork of PostgreSQL, load TPC-H (SF 0.01), train the Proto-X agent, and tune.
./scripts/quickstart.sh postgres tpch 0.01 protox
```

## Overview

Autonomous DBMS research often involves more engineering than research.
As new advances in state-of-the-art technology are made, it is common to find that they have
reimplemented the database tuning pipeline from scratch: workload capture, database setup,
training data collection, model creation, model deployment, and more.
Moreover, these bespoke pipelines make it difficult to combine different techniques even when they
should be independent (e.g., using a different operator latency model in a tuning algorithm).

The database gym project is our attempt at standardizing the APIs between these disparate tasks,
allowing researchers to mix-and-match the different pipeline components.
It draws inspiration from the Farama Foundation's Gymnasium (formerly OpenAI Gym), which
accelerates the development and comparison of reinforcement learning algorithms by providing a set
of agents, environments, and a standardized API for communicating between them.
Through the database gym, we hope to save other people time and reimplementation effort by
providing an extensible open-source platform for autonomous DBMS research.

This project is under active development.
Currently, we decompose the database tuning pipeline into the following components:

1. Workload: collection, forecasting, synthesis
2. Database: database loading, instrumentation, orchestrating workload execution
3. Agent: identifying tuning actions, suggesting an action

## Repository Structure

`task.py` is the entrypoint for all tasks.
The tasks are grouped into categories that correspond to the top-level directories of the repository:

- `benchmark` - tasks to generate data and queries for different benchmarks (e.g., TPC-H, JOB)
- `dbms` - tasks to build and start DBMSs (e.g., PostgreSQL)

## Credits

The Database Gym project rose from the ashes of the [NoisePage](https://db.cs.cmu.edu/projects/noisepage/) self-driving DBMS project.

The first prototype was written by [Patrick Wang](https://github.com/wangpatrick57), integrating [Boot (VLDB 2024)](https://github.com/lmwnshn/boot) and [Proto-X (VLDB 2024)](https://github.com/17zhangw/protox) into a cohesive system.

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has gained traction in academia and industry for database management system (DBMS) automation. Although studies demonstrate that ML-based tuning agents match or exceed human expert performance in optimizing DBMSs, researchers continue to build bespoke tuning pipelines from the ground up. The lack of a reusable infrastructure leads to redundant engineering effort and increased difficulty in comparing modeling methods. This paper demonstrates the database gym framework, a standardized training environment that provides a unified API of pluggable components. The database gym simplifies ML model training and evaluation to accelerate autonomous DBMS research. In this demonstration, we showcase the effectiveness of automated tuning and the gym's ease of use by allowing a human expert to compete against an ML-based tuning agent implemented in the gym.},
